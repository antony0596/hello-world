Git tutorial

Hi everyone, my name is Tony. I'm teaching myself how to code and this is just me trying to learn GitHub for version control. I currently have experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C#. I'm looking forward to become a great developer. My only project so far is chromebooktester.com. You should check it out! Currenty working on a video game using C# and Unity.
